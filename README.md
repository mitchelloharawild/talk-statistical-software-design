#### Abstract

The design of software interfaces can vary significantly depending on
the domain, programming language, and the individual preferences of
developers. Despite these differences, there are common themes that can
distinguish good code from bad. In this talk, I will examine the common
coding styles used in statistical software, provide examples of how
these styles work well in their intended context but operate poorly
elsewhere, and offer tips for writing high quality code that is
user-friendly.

<!-- * Good code, bad code (smell and feel) -->
<!-- * R, Python, Julia, C++ -->
<!-- * Base R, tidy R -->

#### Structure

- Human interface devices (HID) for statistical computing (point and
  click, VR, focus on writing code)
- Variability of code design by domain, language, and author
- Differences in code domain (math, statistics, websites, data)
- Differences in code language (R, Python, Julia, C++… prophet example
  for how it can go wrong)
- Differences by developer (Base R, Tidy R, Bioconductor - good code,
  bad code)
- Tips for writing good code and avoiding bad code (mostly for R, but
  with some generality to the style of other languages)

#### Format

30 minute seminar followed by a 15 minute Q&A.
